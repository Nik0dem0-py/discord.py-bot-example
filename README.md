# nextcord-bot-example

Welcome! :heart: I'm back at it again, this time it's going to be better. An hour ago (11.11.21 around 10pm), I leaked my token :rofl:, Discord's bot DM'ed me (great system discord!) Anyways, where was I? Ah yes, here are the instruction how to use it!

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.9.x is recommended, though 3.8.x could be used.
- All required packages are in the `requirements.txt` file.
- A computer that is able to run Windows 7/8.x/10 or macOS 10.9 **or** chad linux :sunglasses:


## Instructions - How to discord bot. :robot:

**1. First of all you download the files? Or do we do it later? :thinking: Who am I kidding?**

Press the little code button on the top right corner, and press "Download ZIP", or;

```
git clone https://github.com/Nik0dem0-py/discord.py-bot-example.git
```

Easy eh? :thumbsup:

**2.  Open a terminal :computer: in the directory, and run:**

```
python3 -m venv discordbot
```

Still pretty easy? :wink:

**2.5.  In the same directory, run:**

For windows:

```
tutorial-env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

For chad linux and macOS:

```
source tutorial-env/bin/activate
```


**3. Create a file name ".env"**

In that .env file, paste in your token from [here](https://discord.com/developers).

```
bottoken=token.in.here
```

**4. Hit that run button and BOOM! :white_check_mark:**

You can open your IDE of choice and turn run it there

**or:**

```
python3 launcher.py
```
Success! you have a working discord.py bot! :thumbsup:

**If you were unable to do all the steps, you are legally ~~dumb~~ uneducated in terms of computer knowledge.**
