# discord.py-bot-example

Welcome! :heart: I'm back at it again, this time it's going to be better. An hour ago (11.11.21 around 10pm), I leaked my token :rofl:, Discord's bot DM'ed me (great system discord!) Anyways, where was I? Ah yes, here are the instruction how to use it!

## Instructions - How to discord bot. :robot:

**1. First of all you download the files? Or do we do it later? :thinking: Who am I kidding?**

Press the little code button on the top right corner, and press "Download ZIP", or;

`git clone https://github.com/Nik0dem0-py/discord.py-bot-example.git`

Easy eh? :thumbsup:

**2.  Open a terminal :computer: in the directory, and run:**

`pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

Still pretty easy? :wink:

**3. Create a file name ".env"**

In that .env file, paste in your token from [here](https://discord.com/developers).

**4. Hit that run button and BOOM! :white_check_mark:**

It works!

**If you were unable to do all the steps, you are legally ~~dumb~~ uneducated in terms of computer knowledge.**
